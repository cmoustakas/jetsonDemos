	Based On detect-net Nvidia's Algorithm the detectN_stitch.cu code loads a pretrained  neural network and renders frames 
with overlay boxes, in adittion also provides stitched images for further in-depth image recognition on a parallel 
computing concept.In order to understand the code i highly recommend to run stitch.cu in stitch subfoldedr because the steps are 
more clear and its generally serial.
